Join Uber for a discussion of Uber’s role in the future of urban mobility. We’ll discuss questions like: Is Uber able to provide service in lower density or more underserved areas than traditional taxi services? Can a company that moves cars around the city help get cars off the road? What’s the long term impact of the availability of Uber and Uber-like services on traditional public transport? On Congestion?
