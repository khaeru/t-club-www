The **MIT Transportation Club**—or **T-Club**—aims to bring together the transportation community for education, networking, and research collaboration. Founded in the spring of 2010, the organization has grown rapidly to include over 300 members from across all Schools of the Institute. Membership in the MIT Transportation Club is open to *any* member of the wider MIT community.
