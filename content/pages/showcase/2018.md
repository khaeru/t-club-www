**“A Free Lunch: Does So-Called Zero Cost Bike Share Actually Work?”**

The MIT Transportation Club is excited to welcome our keynote speaker: Emily Gates, Director of Operational Strategy at Motivate International, Inc, a bike share design, deployment, and management company located in Brooklyn, NY. Motivate manages the systems in New York (Citi Bike), Boston (Hubway), Washington, D.C. (Capital Bikeshare), Chicago (Divvy) and others both in the US and internationally. She was previously the General Manager of Hubway, the Boston metropolitan area's 1,800 bicycle bike share operator. With over 185 stations in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline, she oversaw the entire operation and marketing for the system for Motivate. She was previously a systems performance specialist and hardware product manager for the Motivate Technology team helping to improve processes involving the maintenance and deployment of bike stations, docks and software/hardware issue resolution.

Emily graduated in 2015 with a M.S. in Transportation from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, she was a research assistant in the MIT Transit Lab researching real-time transportation mobile applications and how to bring these apps and real-time data to new cities.
