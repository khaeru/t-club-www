The MIT Transportation Club will be organizing the 5th edition of the MIT Transportation Showcase for Spring 2015. This is the T-Club's flagship event, and has been widely accepted among the students, alumni, faculty, and professionals that are part of the MIT transportation community.

The main objective of the event is to showcase the transportation research carried out at MIT, strengthening the connections among the MIT transportation community, particularly between industry and academia. The Showcase is also an excellent venue for students and faculty to get advice, feedback and ideas for future research, as well as to connect with possible research collaborators.

**CAREERS** — connecting students and employers<br/>
**RESEARCH** — enabling collaboration<br/>
**NETWORKING** — forging new connections

More information will be available soon.
