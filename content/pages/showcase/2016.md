## Industry - How can you participate? ##

### Attend! ###

Any alumni, transportation professionals, or companies can come to present their work, discover cutting-edge research, and form lasting connections. Any company that is interested in setting up a promotional table for recruiting or sharing their work at the event must pay a basic registration fee of $150. This covers table space for promotional materials, nametags for company representatives, two printed copies of the resume book to be received on the day of the event, and food and drink for company representatives during the reception. \*This participation fee is a single payment and does not scale with the number of representatives attending.

### Sponsor! ###

Being a sponsor of the Transportation Showcase is a great way to get the most out of the event by engaging directly with future research collaborators and connecting with the rising talent in the MIT transportation community. If your company or organization would like to become more involved and help ensure the long-term success of this annual event, consider one of our three levels of sponsorship. \*Any sponsorship automatically covers the participation fee.

**Silver Sponsor** — $600  
As a silver sponsor, the company will have its logo printed on all promotional materials for the event, a larger and more prominently placed table for recruiting, and day-of access to the electronic version of the resume book.

**Gold Sponsor** — $1200  
As a gold sponsor, the company will have a *large* logo printed on all promotional materials for the event, will have their choice of a large, prominent table and banner space for recruiting, and will have early access to the electronic version of the resume book (for pre-event scouting).

As a platinum sponsor, the company will enjoy all the privileges of a gold sponsor. In addition, the platinum sponsor will have access to guest parking permits, and a full-page advertisement in the event program and on the event website.

## Collaborators

While the 6th annual MIT Transportation Showcase is primarily organized by the MIT Transportation Club, the event would not be possible without the funding and support provided by Transportation@MIT, the New England University Transportation Center, and the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. The Career Fair is registered and held in collaboration with the MIT Global Education & Career Development Office. We would also like to thank the MIT Museum and the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education who give us access to a wonderful venue.
