The MIT Transportation Club is organizing the 6th edition of the MIT Transportation Showcase in February 2016 at the **[MIT Museum](http://web.mit.edu/museum)**.

The Showcase is the MIT Transportation Club's flagship event, and has been widely accepted among the students, alumni, faculty, and professionals that are part of the MIT transportation community. The event showcases the transportation research carried out at MIT, strengthening the connections among the MIT transportation community, particularly between industry and academia. The Showcase is also an excellent venue for students and faculty to get advice, feedback and ideas for future research, as well as to connect with possible research collaborators.
