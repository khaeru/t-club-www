**Accelerating Auto & Mobility Innovation – Early Observations of Open Source Toolkits and Crowdsourcing Platforms**

K. Venkatesh Prasad, Ph.D.  
Senior Technical Leader & Member of Ford Technology Advisory Board  
Ford Motor Company

### Abstract ###

In a marked departure from an almost exclusively centralized framework for innovation and its resultant economic benefit envisioned by Joseph Schumpeter, there is growing evidence of a new and vast shorefront for innovation that is mostly decentralized, diffuses in a free and open manner and is intensely powered by peer-innovator networks, as documented in the life-long research of Professor Eric von Hippel at the Sloan School.  The catalyst for this emergence of decentralized innovation has been the dramatic reduction in the costs of computing and communications that has accelerated development of truly functional and “executable” prototypes or “minimum viable products” not just in the world of “bits” (software) but also in the world of “atoms” (hardware).  
 
In this talk, we will use examples from our numerous collaborations with students, faculty members, and with employees and their networks within Ford Motor Company, and with startups and established firms, to outline some exciting new opportunities for the pedagogy, research, and delivery of automobile and, more broadly, mobility related innovations.  We will emphasize the growing importance of employee-driven peer instruction and open-source (hardware and software) toolkits in accelerating the pace of customer-focused new product and service creation.

## Collaborators

While the 7th annual MIT Transportation Showcase is primarily organized by the MIT Transportation Club, the event would not be possible without the funding and support provided by Transportation@MIT, the New England University Transportation Center, and the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. The Career Fair is registered and held in collaboration with the MIT Global Education & Career Development Office. We would also like to thank the MIT Museum and the Office of the Dean for Graduate Education who give us access to a wonderful venue.
