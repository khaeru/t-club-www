## President: Joanna Moody

**Joanna Moody** <[jcmoody at mit dot edu](mailto:jcmoody@MIT.EDU)> is a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the Interdisciplinary Program in Transportation. As a member of the <a href="https://mobility.mit.edu" target="_blank">JTL Urban Mobility Lab</a>, Joanna explores how implicit or subconscious biases and preferences related to car usage and ownership can influence travel behavior and impact transportation planning and operations. Also as a member of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hsr-group/" target="_blank">Regional Transportation and High Speed Rail Group</a>, Joanna works in collaboration with the East Japan Railway Company researching international high-speed rail developments as complex socio-technical systems, with a particular interest in how the technology and infrastructure interface with governing and managing institutions and users. At MIT, Joanna has received both a USDOT University Transportation Funding Center Fellowship (2014) and the U.S. Department of Transportation FHWA Eisenhower Graduate Fellowship (2015 and 2016). She has served as the Transportation Club VP, Transportation Showcase and as the coordinator for the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics lecture series for the past three years. She holds a Masters of Science in Transportation degree from MIT as well as Bachelors degrees in Mathematics, Physics, and Japanese from Bates College.

**André Snoeck** <[asnoeck at mit dot edu](mailto:asnoeck@MIT.EDU)> is a research assistant and Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="http://megacitylab.mit.edu" target="_blank">Megacity Logistics Lab</a> at the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics. His research focuses on the last mile of urban freight transportation and he conducts various products in cooperation with companies such as Coca-Cola, FEMSA, and AB InBev. Before coming to MIT, he received both his Bachelor's and Master's in Industrial Engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands with a specialization in Operations Management and Logistics. In between, he co-founded <a href="http://www.solarteameindhoven.nl/">Solar Team Eindhoven</a> to develop Stella, the world's first solar-powered family car to show the world what the future of transportation looks like. The team won the 2013 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, followed by the award for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/8th-annual-crunchies-awards/winners/" target="_blank">Best Technology Achievement</a> at the annual Silicon Valley Crunchie awards in 2015, beating Apple Pay and SpaceX.

## Vice President, Transportation Showcase: Adham Kalila
<img class="exec_pic" src="/image/board/17-18/Adham_Kalila.jpeg">

**Adham Kalila** <[kalila at mit dot edu](mailto:kalila@@MIT.EDU)> is a second year master of science in transportation student. His love for transit grew after a failed attempt at studying geotechnical and structural engineering at McGill. His passion for cities meets his love for transit in <a href="http://transportforcairo.com/" target="_blank">Transport for Cairo</a>, a project he cofounded to map and research informal transportation in Cairo, Egypt where he grew up. He loves to cook, read, travel, and silently (or outwardly) judge people for incorrect grammar. You’ll love him.

## Website & Media: Sharlene Chiu
<img class="exec_pic" src="/image/board/17-18/Sharlene_Chiu.jpg">

**Sharlene Chiu** <[sharc at mit dot edu](mailto:sharc@MIT.EDU)> is a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. She first became dazzled by transportation when she worked as a research assistant for the <a href="http://senseable.mit.edu" target="_blank">Senseable City Lab</a>. Her initial project aimed to reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions by developing a system that detects vehicles and adjusts traffic signals in real time. Currently, she's participating in the SuperUROP program, a year-long research commitment for undergraduates. Sharlene is working with the <a href="https://its.mit.edu" target="_blank">Intelligent Transportation Systems Lab</a> on a project called <a href="https://its.mit.edu/mobility-future" target="_blank">Mobility of the Future</a>, for which she will leverage her EECS background to analyze simulations and gain insight into the courses of action that cities should take to achieve positive change in traffic, emissions, and so forth.
