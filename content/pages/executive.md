Also as a member of the [Regional Transportation and High Speed Rail Group](http://web.mit.edu/hsr-group/index.html) Joanna’s research focuses on understanding high-speed rail projects as complex socio-technical systems, with a particular interest in how the technology and infrastructure interface with governing and managing institutions and users. As a member of the JTL Urban Mobility Lab, Joanna explores how implicit or subconscious bias and preference can influence travel behavior and impact transportation planning and operations. Joanna has been accepted to take the Ph.D. qualifying exam for the interdisciplinary Transportation program in January. She plans to continue her research into the impacts of transportation systems, with a focus on stakeholder relationships and distributional considerations.

In addition to her scholarly pursuits, Joanna has interned at Cambridge Systematics and collaborated with the World Bank on a financial case study of freight rail profitability schemes for China National Railways. Joanna served as a co-coordinator of the 2015 Transportation Showcase, in charge of company outreach and career fair organization. She is currently a co-coordinator for the MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics (CTL) Distinguished Speaker Lecture Series.
