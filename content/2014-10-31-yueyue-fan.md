With growing electric vehicle demand, the connection between transportation and energy is becoming stronger. Besides the commonly acknowledge physical and functional interdependence between the two systems, in this talk I will discuss some fundamental theories that transcend across the two fields. Specifically, I will dicuss some of the modelling efforts for supporting renewable energy infrastructure planning under uncertainties. The interdependency betweeen difference stakeholders in the system is captured in an energy supply chain network, where new entrants of renewable investors compete with existing generators for natural resources, transmission capacities, and demand markets. Through reformulation, the stochastic energy supply chain planning problem can be converted to solving many traffic network equilibrium problems. Establishing such a connection helps broaden the impact of transportation science to other disciplines.
