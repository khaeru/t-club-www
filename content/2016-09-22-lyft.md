Join Senior Software Engineer Max Rozentsveyg and Data Scientist Yuanyuan Pao as they talk about how Lyft is "Building & Optmizing a Ridesharing Marketplace"

Abstract: Lyft is one of the few companies successfully unlocking new transportation opportunities and redefining car ownership. We are constantly solving challenging technical problems, such as efficiently matching drivers and passengers, computing accurate ETA’s, and optimizing pricing strategies in a two-sided marketplace. Come hear about how we solve these problems for millions of users and rides in real time, and career opportunities within Lyft engineering.

This event is presented in collaboration with the T-Club and the MIT Association of Computational Science and Engineering Students. For those of you unable to join us in person, we will be live-streaming the event via Facebook Live.
