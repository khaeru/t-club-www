Connected vehicle technologies, proliferating sensors, Big Data analytics, cloud computing, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are converging to transform the future of our transportation system, potentially making it safer, cleaner, and vastly more efficient. But research in data management and uses must respond to the unprecedented increase in data availability, volume, and diversity, including new data sources outside the transportation sector. What are the implications and opportunities for the transportation system, and what are its challenges related to privacy, data integration and access, open source, and moving beyond a 20th century model of ITS? How can—or should—transportation be managed in the emerging world of connected vehicles and connected travelers?  To help understand and shape this future, the Volpe Center is researching approaches to collect, transmit, fuse, analyze, and apply data for management and operations of the transportation system. This presentation will address the team’s initial thoughts and invite an open discussion.

Dr. **Matthew R. Cuddy** leads the Connected Cities Project at the U.S. DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, and helps lead a project focused on capture and management of big data for intermodal mobility management. He is also active in data policy, open innovation, and technology transfer. His previous experience includes advising cities on parking policy, writing urban redevelopment guidelines for the State of New Jersey, and developing hybrid vehicle propulsion systems with the U.S. DOE.

Dr. **Alexander K. Epstein**’s lines of work are energy sustainability, climate adaptation, vulnerable road-user safety, and big data driven “Mobility 2.0” in Smart Cities. Dr. Epstein leads vehicle-based safety research in support of NYC and Boston and analyzes novel transportation energy and sustainability technologies for the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and other federal agencies.  He also co-leads first-in-the-U.S. carbon neutral airport programs for MassDOT and FAA and leads a climate adaptation technical committee and tool development for Central New Mexico’s inter-agency climate change planning program.

Prior to Volpe, Dr. Epstein developed nanostructured surfaces and other materials science-based strategies against biofouling at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, where he authored eleven peer-reviewed publications.  

Previously at Draper Laboratories, Epstein supported vehicle integration and testing for the DARPA Urban Challenge autonomous vehicle program as part of Team MIT.
