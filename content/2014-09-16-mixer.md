The MIT Transportation Club invites you to our first event of the year! Join others from around MIT who share a common interest in all things planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, and boats (did we miss a mode?!). Come out and meet the T-Club's new executive board and be surrounded by others who geek out as much as you do about high-speed rail, bike lanes, and driverless cars!

Light hors d'oeuvres and snacks will be provided, but drinks are on you.

*Attendees must be 21 years of age or older.*
