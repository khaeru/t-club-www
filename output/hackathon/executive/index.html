She graduated from Yale in 2013 with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, then spent a year in the Netherlands researching commuting behavior on a Fulbright fellowship. She has also worked as a software engineer at Fitbit, Google and Microsoft. Her research interests include bicycles, urban mobility, and maps. She is also a member of the Cambridge Bicycle Committee. </p>
<p><strong><a href="">Alex Salz</a></strong> &lt;<a href="mailto:alexsalz@MIT.EDU">alexsalz at mit dot edu</a>&gt; is a 2nd year masters student in the transportation program. In the past he has conducted research on revenue management strategies for airlines. After interning with Uber this past summer, he is currently looking at the impact of ridesharing operators on urban parking. His favorite mode of transportation is cycling, having biked across Europe two summers ago.</p>

Also as a member of the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hsr-group/index.html">Regional Transportation and High Speed Rail Group</a> Joanna’s research focuses on understanding high-speed rail projects as complex socio-technical systems, with a particular interest in how the technology and infrastructure interface with governing and managing institutions and users. As a member of the JTL Urban Mobility Lab, Joanna explores how implicit or subconscious bias and preference can influence travel behavior and impact transportation planning and operations. Joanna has been accepted to take the Ph.D. qualifying exam for the interdisciplinary Transportation program in January. She plans to continue her research into the impacts of transportation systems, with a focus on stakeholder relationships and distributional considerations.</p>
<p>In addition to her scholarly pursuits, Joanna has interned at Cambridge Systematics and collaborated with the World Bank on a financial case study of freight rail profitability schemes for China National Railways. Joanna served as a co-coordinator of the 2015 Transportation Showcase, in charge of company outreach and career fair organization.
