<p>The Transportation Showcase is the MIT Transportation Club's flagship event, and is widely attended by the students, alumni, faculty, and professionals that make up the MIT transportation community. The event showcases the transportation research carried out at MIT, strengthening the connections among the MIT transportation community, particularly between industry and academia. The Showcase is also an excellent venue for students and faculty to get advice, feedback and ideas for future research, as well as to connect with possible research collaborators.</p>

Basic registration includes table space for promotional materials, name tags for company representatives, two printed copies of the resume book to be received on the day of the event, and food and refreshments for company representatives during the reception. *This participation fee is a single payment and does not scale with the number of representatives attending.</p>
<h3>Sponsor</h3>
<p>Being a sponsor of the Transportation Showcase is a great way to get the most out of the event by engaging directly with future research collaborators and connecting with the rising talent in the MIT transportation community. If your company or organization would like to become more involved and help ensure the long-term success of this annual event, consider one of our three levels of sponsorship. *Any sponsorship automatically covers the participation fee. </p>
<p><strong>Silver Sponsor | $600</strong></p>
<p>As a silver sponsor, the company will have its logo printed on all promotional materials for the event, a larger and more prominently placed table for recruiting, and day-of access to the electronic version of the resume book. </p>
<p><strong>Gold Sponsor | $1200</strong></p>
<p>As a gold sponsor, the company will have its choice of a large, prominent table together with banner space for recruiting. Furthermore, a large logo will be printed on all promotional materials for the event and the company will get early access to the electronic version of the resume book for pre-event scouting. </p>
<p><strong>Platinum Sponsor | $2200</strong></p>
<p>As a platinum sponsor, the company will enjoy all the privileges of a gold sponsor. In addition, the platinum sponsor will have access to guest parking permits and a full-page advertisement in the event pro- gram and on the event website. Moreover, the Transportation Club will work with your company to set up a private lunchtime recruiting event on campus before or after the Showcase. </p>
<h2>Students - How can you get involved?</h2>
