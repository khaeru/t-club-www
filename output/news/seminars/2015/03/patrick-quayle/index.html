                <p>Patrick Quayle — Managing Director, Network &amp; Fleet Strategy, American Airlines<br/>

<p>Through the merger with US Airways, American has become the largest airline in the world. Since merger close in late 2013, great progress has been made to integrate operations and return American to profitability. But there is also plenty of work left to do. In his talk, Patrick will give an overview of key accomplishments and challenges in integrating the two networks and fleets. On the network side will touch on the ongoing efforts to align the bank structures of American’s hubs as well as US Airways’ transition from Star Alliance to Oneworld.  </p>
<p>American’s fleet is also undergoing a major renewal with two new aircraft joining the fleet every week. This not only provides American’s customers with a consistent state-of-the-art experience, but guarantees greater deployment and scheduling flexibility with better reliability and performance. The presentation will highlight some of American’s major reconfiguration projects as well as the impact of new fleet types like the 787 or A350 on American’s network.  </p>
