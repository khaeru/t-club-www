&lt;p&gt;Through the merger with US Airways, American has become the largest airline in the world. Since merger close in late 2013, great progress has been made to integrate operations and return American to profitability. But there is also plenty of work left to do. In his talk, Patrick will give an overview of key accomplishments and challenges in integrating the two networks and fleets. On the network side will touch on the ongoing efforts to align the bank structures of American’s hubs as well as US Airways’ transition from Star Alliance to Oneworld.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American’s fleet is also undergoing a major renewal with two new aircraft joining the fleet every week. This not only provides American’s customers with a consistent state-of-the-art experience, but guarantees greater deployment and scheduling flexibility with better reliability and performance. The presentation will highlight some of American’s major reconfiguration projects as well as the impact of new fleet types like the 787 or A350 on American’s network.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Quayle is the Managing Director of Network Strategy and Fleet Analytics for American Airlines, a position he assumed in January 2015. In this role, Patrick is responsible for driving network and fleet strategies to implementation. Prior to his promotion, he was the Director of Network Analytics. Recent projects include a strategic review of hubs and portfolio of flying, optimizing density on the Boeing 777-200ER, 737-800, and building configurations for 787 and A350 aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick was previously Senior Manager, Corporate Planning for American Airlines. In that role, he worked on the American Airlines Restructuring; building the five-year Network plan for bankruptcy process/American Business Plan, and negotiating the labor contract with the pilots’ union. In addition to the restructuring process, he led a team responsible for Network Performance and Commercial Planning strategies. In this role, he was responsible for collaborating with the Commercial organization to identify and implement strategies to optimize financial performance. Prior to his role in Corporate Planning, Patrick was in charge of capacity decisions and route planning for the Atlantic Joint Business with British Airways and Iberia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick was previously a Senior Analyst in Corporate Planning, Finance, and Sales Planning within American, and spent three years at Continental Airlines in Network Planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick earned a bachelor’s degree from Rice University and has a MBA from the University of Bath, UK.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Potential Value of Big Data Analytics for Transportation Systems Management</title><link href="http://t-club.mit.edu/seminars/2015/02/cuddy-epstein" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>MIT Transportation Club</name></author><id>tag:t-club.mit.edu,2015-02-13:seminars/2015/02/cuddy-epstein</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Matthew R.

&lt;p&gt;Connected vehicle technologies, proliferating sensors, Big Data analytics, cloud computing, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are converging to transform the future of our transportation system, potentially making it safer, cleaner, and vastly more efficient. But research in data management and uses must respond to the unprecedented increase in data availability, volume, and diversity, including new data sources outside the transportation sector. What are the implications and opportunities for the transportation system, and what are its challenges related to privacy, data integration and access, open source, and moving beyond a 20th century model of ITS? How can—or should—transportation be managed in the emerging world of connected vehicles and connected travelers?  To help understand and shape this future, the Volpe Center is researching approaches to collect, transmit, fuse, analyze, and apply data for management and operations of the transportation system. This presentation will address the team’s initial thoughts and invite an open discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrified modes of transportation: vehicles, buses and trains fundamentally couple the transportation and power grids. This coupling presents new challenges in the operation of each system which would not have existed if each was operated independently. This presentation advocates an enhanced Intelligent Transportation Energy System (ITES) which includes an integrated approach to transportation and energy management. At its core, the ITES requires a new transportation electrification assessment methodology that draws upon microscopic traffic simulation, power grid dynamics, and Big Data-Driven use case modeling. Such an ITES would come to include coupled operations management decisions including:  vehicle dispatching, charging queue management, coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid ancillary services. The presentation concludes with simulation results from the first full scale electric vehicle integration study which was recently conducted for a taxi-fleet use case in Abu Dhabi. The study suggests a close collaboration between the Abu Dhabi Department of Transportation and the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority in future large scale deployments of electrified transportation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With growing electric vehicle demand, the connection between transportation and energy is becoming stronger. Besides the commonly acknowledge physical and functional interdependence between the two systems, in this talk I will discuss some fundamental theories that transcend across the two fields. Specifically, I will dicuss some of the modelling efforts for supporting renewable energy infrastructure planning under uncertainties. The interdependency betweeen difference stakeholders in the system is captured in an energy supply chain network, where new entrants of renewable investors compete with existing generators for natural resources, transmission capacities, and demand markets. Through reformulation, the stochastic energy supply chain planning problem can be converted to solving many traffic network equilibrium problems. Establishing such a connection helps broaden the impact of transportation science to other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy is a critical component of our efforts moving towards achieving sustainable development. In addition to the three aspects of promoting access, renewables, and efficiency, which have been emphasized in many of international proposals in the field of energy, it is also important to take into consideration the dimension of resilience in energy systems. The implementation of resilient energy systems requires social transformations, which in turn depend upon active engagement with all stakeholders. Such an engagement needs a quantitative understanding of the socio-economic practices underlying resilient energy systems. The ecological information-based network approach can be used as a methodological tool to evaluate the system-level interactions and synergies of various socio-technical practices leading to resiliency of energy resources. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of the ecological information-based approach in evaluating the resiliency of energy systems at the global level. With the increasing globalization of trade, there remains a critical knowledge gap on the link between embodied energy in the production and consumption of traded goods. To bridge this knowledge gap, we attempt to quantitatively explore global energy resilience through an examination of global embodied electricity trade based on multi-regional input-output (MRIO) networks, evaluating system-level metrics relevant to resilience such as efficiency, robustness, and flow dependencies among 57 economic sectors in 134 countries. This research highlights future directions of research utilizing network approaches towards developing objective policy tools for managing resilience in energy systems. From a broader perspective, this research addresses a general issue of global governance of various resources through networks. Network governance for sustainability would be a grand challenge worth exploring seriously, including energy, water, food, and other materials and resources. By identifying potential problems in the networks and coordinating our technologies and behavior to address them, we will be able to tackle with the global challenge of sustainability collectively through network governance. This research is an attempt through a study on energy to explore the possibilities and implications of the approach of network governance of resources for sustainability at the global level. Implications for transportation will be discussed with opportunities and challenges identified.&lt;/p&gt;
